# Kidney segmentation case study

## Data
All data necessary for the case study is in the Data folder.

## Scripts
Shows the code and scripts used to load and run the models

## AI and ML
An article meant to familiarize the participant with how machine learning is used in medical imaging

## CS3_Rubric
The rubric used for scoring case study submissions.

## Hook Document
The document that provides context on the case study and describes the deliverable.

## Training a classifier
Extremely important document: describes the process of training a classification model using pytorch
