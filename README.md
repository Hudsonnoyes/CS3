## Section 3: Reproduction Steps
In this section, you should give explicit step-by-step instructions to reproduce the Results of your study. These instructions should be written in straightforward plain English, but they must be concise, but detailed and precise enough, to make it possible for an interested user to reproduce your results without much difficulty. N.B. This section will be crucial for the CS1 assignment, where you'll be required to reproduce the results of other groups. Therefore, make sure to explain this section thoroughly. 

### Part 1: Acquiring Data

1. Follow ```data_import_process.md```
